#Monte Carlo Method for Option Pricing

##Project Overview
This project explores the application of the Monte Carlo method for pricing financial options. It involves simulating the behavior of options to estimate their fair value. The Monte Carlo method is particularly useful for complex financial derivatives where analytical solutions are challenging.

##Monte Carlo Method
The Monte Carlo method uses random sampling to solve quantitative problems. It is widely used in various fields such as finance, engineering, and physics to model uncertainty and predict outcomes.

##Option Pricing
Options are financial derivatives that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price. Key terms include:

Call Options: Right to buy
Put Options: Right to sell
Strike Price: Predetermined price
Expiration Date: Last date the option can be exercised
Black-Scholes Model
The Black-Scholes model provides a theoretical price for European-style options. Key assumptions include constant volatility and interest rates, no dividends, and no transaction costs. The model is expressed through specific formulas to price call and put options.

##Monte Carlo Method for Option Pricing
The Monte Carlo method simulates the underlying asset's price path to estimate the option's fair value. It involves generating numerous random price paths, calculating the option payoff for each path, and averaging the results.

##Conclusion
The Monte Carlo method is a powerful tool for pricing complex financial options. This project demonstrates its application, highlighting its effectiveness in handling scenarios where traditional models may fall short.
